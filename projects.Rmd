## Data Analysis Projects

Here are some of my key projects demonstrating various data analysis skills.

### Project 1: Introduction to E-Business Analytics

**Objective:Develop skills to work with R-Studio**

**Key Skills**

- Download the latest version of R from CRAN and install on either a Windows or Mac computer.
- Download and install RStudio on either a Windows or Mac computer.
- Evaluate if your installations and understanding work through applying some basic R code principles.
- Install the R Markdown package.
- Generate high quality reports.
- Use data analysis code 'chunks' inside your report

**Project Analysis**

This analysis evaluates 153 days of website activity across three operational areas: Engagement, Performance, and Server Load. Results indicate a strong positive relationship between user engagement and site performance, with a correlation of 0.70, suggesting that higher engagement levels reliably coincide with improved performance metrics. Engagement scores range from 56 to 97, with a median of 79, demonstrating generally strong user interaction. Performance values peak at 168, although the presence of 37 missing observations highlights a need for improved data collection. Overall, the findings suggest that management should prioritize initiatives that increase user engagement, as this is likely to yield meaningful performance gains.
